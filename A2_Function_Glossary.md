Navigation in R
----


```r

ls()           # list objects in the current workspace
help(options)  # learn about available options

*Poppr* functions
----

Our primer is heavily based on the *poppr* and *adegenet* packages. To get help on any of their functions type a question mark before the empty function call as in:


```r
# Information on pacakges or functions
browseVignettes(package = 'poppr')    # see vignettes for poppr
vignette('poppr_manual')              # see manual for poppr
?mlg()           # open the R documentiaon of the function mlg()

# Poppr functions
help(package="poppr")   # shows all functions contained in poppr package

```
