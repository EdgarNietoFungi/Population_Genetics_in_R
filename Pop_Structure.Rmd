title: '9: Population structure: $G_{ST}$, genetic distance, clustering, and minimum spanning networks'
---

In this chapter we explore various ways of assessing if population are
structured (e.g., differentiated). You can think of population structure as
identifying clusters or groups of more closely related individuals resulting
from reduced gene flow among these groups. Populations can be studied to
determine if they are structured by using for example population differentiation
$G_{ST}$, clustering, or graphing of minimum spanning networks (MSN). Note, that
this chapter will utilize many data sets due to the unique features offered by
each. Let's first look at an example of population differentiation.

$G_{ST}$ an example with *Felis catus* data.
----

Assessing genetic diversity almost always starts with an analysis of a parameter
such as $G_{ST}$. There are [lengthy debates](http://www.molecularecologist.com/2011/03/should-i-use-fst-gst-or-d-2/)
as to what measure of differentiation is better `r citep(bib['meirmans2011assessing'])`. 
Instead of going into that lengthy debate, it would be more worthwhile to point
you into the direction of a package dedicated to Modern Methods of
Differentiation called *mmod*. We will use the data set *nancycats* containing
17 colonies of cats collected from Nancy, France. As cats tend to stay within
small groups, we expect to see some population differentiation. In terms of
these diversity measures, an index of 0 indicates no differentiation, whereas 1
indicates that populations are segregating for differing alleles.

Let's load the package and the example data set.

```{r loadstuff}
if (!require("mmod")){
  install.packages("mmod", repos = "http://cran.at.r-project.org")
  require("mmod")
}
data(nancycats)
nancycats
```

Now we will use Hendrick's standardized $G_{ST}$ to assess population structure 
among these populations `r citep(bib['hedrick2005standardized'])`.

```{r nancycats}
Gst_Hedrick(nancycats)
```
What does this output tell us?

Genetic Distance
----

If we wanted to analyze the relationship between individuals or populations, we
would use genetic distance measures which calculate the "distance" between
samples based on their genetic profile. These distances can be visualized with
heatmaps, dendrograms, or minimum spanning networks. In the package *poppr*,
there are several distances available:

|Distance|Function|Marker type|
|----|----|----|----|
|Bruvo's distance|`bruvo.dist`|microsatellite|
|Provesti's distance|`provesti.dist`|any|
|Nei's distance|`nei.dist`|any|
|Rogers' distance|`rogers.dist`|any|
|Edwards' distance|`edwards.dist`|any|
|Reynolds' distance|`reynolds.dist`|any|

One common way to visualize a genetic distance is with a dendrogram.


```{r, cattletree, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 7}
library("ape")
data(microbov)
microbov <- as.genclone(microbov, hierarchy = other(microbov))
microbov
namehierarchy(microbov) <- ~Country/Breed/Species
setpop(microbov) <- ~Country/Breed
set.seed(999)
ten_samples <- sample(nInd(microbov), 10)
mic10 <- microbov[ten_samples]

```

The rest of this chapter will utilize Bruvo's distance `r citep(bib['bruvo2004simple'])`. 

Minimum spanning network
----

For this section, we will use the `monpop` data set from `rcitep(bib['everhart2014finescale'])`. 
See [Chapter6](Genotypic_EvenRichDiv.html) for more details. We will be focusing
on sources of multilocus genotypes. The life cycle of the pathogen *Monilinia
fructicola* begins with an ascospore (sexual propagule) released from a
mummified peach fruit that had overwintered on the ground. It infects an
emerging blossom that, in turn, asexually infects fruit, which proceed with
cyclical infections. We might have questions such as:

1. Are the major genotypes of Fruit Rot (FR) samples closely related?
2. To what degree do the Blossom Blight (BB) samples contribute to the FR?


Let's load the data:

```{r}
library("poppr")
data(monpop)
splithierarchy(monpop) <- ~Tree/Year/Symptom
summary(monpop)
```

We notice that tree number 26 is the only one to have been sampled for all three
years. Let's use it as an example.

```{r}
setpop(monpop) <- ~Tree
t26 <- popsub(monpop, "26")
setpop(t26) <- ~Year/Symptom
t26
```

Now that we have our tree, let's calculate a MSN using Bruvo's distance 
`r citep(bib['bruvo2004simple'])`. Remember that this distance is based on a 
stepwise mutation model, so we have to first specify what kind of repeats units 
we have in our data (eg. dinucleotide = 2, trinucleotide = 3, etc.):

```{r}
# Set up our repeat lengths and populations to analyze
reps <- c(CHMFc4 = 7, CHMFc5 = 2, CHMFc12 = 4, 
          SEA = 4, SED = 4, SEE = 2, SEG = 6,
          SEI = 3, SEL = 4, SEN = 2, 
          SEP = 4, SEQ = 2, SER = 4)

sub9 <- c("9_BB", "9_FR")

# Calculate the MSN
t26.9msn <- bruvo.msn(t26, replen = reps, sublist = sub9, showplot = FALSE)
```

The minimum spanning network is calculated via `bruvo.msn`. I've set the
argument `showplot = FALSE` because I want to use the more powerful function
`plot_poppr_msn` to view the MSN. In this, I'm telling it to lable none of the
samples, color populations using the "cm.colors" palette and scale the size of
the nodes to $log_{1.25}$. If you want to know what other things this function can
do, simply type `help("plot_poppr_msn")`

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# Visualize the network
set.seed(9001)
plot_poppr_msn(t26, t26.9msn, inds = "none", palette = cm.colors, nodebase = 1.25)
```

We can see that the Blossom Blight in the tree (pink pie pieces) heavily contributed to the major groups of MLGs found in the Fruit Rot (blue pie pieces). 

> **Try it!** See if you can produce similar graphs with the 2010 and 2011 populations.

K-means hierarchical clustering
----

A recent study reported that the origin of the potato late blight pathogen *Phytophthora infestans* lies in Mexico as opposed to South America `r citep(bib['goss2014irish'])`. We saw in the previous chapter that South American populations showed signatures of clonal reproduction while Mexican populations showed no evidence rejecting the null hypothesis of random mating. In this section, we will use K-means clustering in combination with bootstrapped dendrograms to see how well this pattern holds up. Clonal populations should have short terminal branch lengths and should cluster according to those branches. Panmictic populations will show no clear pattern. Let's look at the data: 

```{r}
data(Pinf)
Pinf
```

First, we will perform a cluster analysis:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
MX <- popsub(Pinf, "North America")
MXclust <- find.clusters(MX)
```
![MX_PCA](Pop_Structure_files/figure-html/MXPCA.png)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("Choose the number PCs to retain (>=1): \n")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=TRUE, comment= ">"}
message("50")
```

PC stands for principal component, are unitless transofrmations of your data that explaining the variance observed. For the purposes of `find.clusters`, we can keep as many as we want.

![MX_CLUSTER](Pop_Structure_files/figure-html/MXCLUST.png)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("Choose the number PCs to retain (>=2: \n")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=TRUE, comment= ">"}
message("3")
```

BIC stands for "Bayesian Information Criterion". The lower the BIC value, the better. On the x axis are the number of clusters. We see that there is a bend at 3 clusters, indicating that the data clusters optimally into three groups. 


```{r, echo = FALSE}
MX <- popsub(Pinf, "North America")
MXclust <- find.clusters(MX, n.pca = 50, n.clust = 3)
```

And now we can see the cluster assignments:

```{r}
MXclust
```

We will go through the same procedure for the South American population.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SA <- popsub(Pinf, "South America")
SAclust <- find.clusters(SA)
```
![SA_PCA](Pop_Structure_files/figure-html/SAPCA.png)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("Choose the number PCs to retain (>=1): \n")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=TRUE, comment= ">"}
message("30")
```

![SA_CLUSTER](Pop_Structure_files/figure-html/SACLUST.png)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("Choose the number PCs to retain (>=2): \n")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=TRUE, comment= ">"}
message("4")
```

Notice here that there is no uptick in the curve. This indicates that there [might not be enough information in the data set to properly cluster](http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/adegenet-forum/2011-June/000303.html). We will go ahead by choosing the highest number of clusters:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
SA <- popsub(Pinf, "South America")
SAclust <- find.clusters(SA, n.pca = 30, n.clust = 4)
```

### Trees

Now we will build trees. We are using Bruvo's distance since polyploids bias calculation of other distances: 

```{r, trees, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 7}
pinfreps <- c(2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2)
MXtree <- bruvo.boot(MX, replen = pinfreps, cutoff = 50, quiet = TRUE)
SAtree <- bruvo.boot(SA, replen = pinfreps, cutoff = 50, quiet = TRUE)
```

We see very long terminal branches in the MX tree. Let's see how the groups we found with the clustering algorithm match up:

```{r, grouptree, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 7}
library("ape")
cols <- rainbow(4)
plot.phylo(MXtree, cex = 0.8, font = 2, adj = 0, tip.color = cols[MXclust$grp],
           label.offset = 0.0125)
nodelabels(MXtree$node.label, adj = c(1.3, -0.5), frame = "n", cex = 0.8, 
           font = 3, xpd = TRUE)
axisPhylo(3)
```

You can see that the assigned clusters don't necessarily group with the dendrogram clusters. Let's see what happens when we view this with the South American population:

```{r, grouptreeSA, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 7}
plot.phylo(SAtree, cex = 0.8, font = 2, adj = 0, tip.color = cols[SAclust$grp],
           label.offset = 0.0125)
nodelabels(SAtree$node.label, adj = c(1.3, -0.5), frame = "n", cex = 0.8, 
           font = 3, xpd = TRUE)
axisPhylo(3)
```

Everything clusters together nicely, further supporting a non-panmictic population. 

Other methods
----

Not all methods of clustering need to be based on Bruvos's distance. There are others
available. See `?nei.dist` for more details. The function `aboot` will perform bootstrap
analysis on any distance given for individuals or populations, and `poppr.msn` will create
minimum spanning networks given a genind object and a distance.
