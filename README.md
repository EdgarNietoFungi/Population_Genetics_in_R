Welcome! This primer provides a concise introduction to conducting applied
analyses of population genetic data in R, with a special emphasis on non-model
populations including clonal or partially clonal organisms. It provides a
valuable resource for tackling the nitty-gritty analysis of populations that do
not necessarily conform to textbook genetics and might or might not be in Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium and panmixia. While this primer does not require extensive
knowledge of programming in R, the user is expected to install R and all
packages required for this primer.

Please note that this primer is still being written and will be changing as we
continue writing it. Please provide us feedback on any errors you might find or
suggestions for improvement. The primer is currently published
[here](http://grunwaldlab.github.io/Population_Genetics_in_R/).

>*I was really impressed with what you've accomplished with [poppr], it is very thoughtful and addressed a number of things I never considered but which many pop gen folks that I know deal with all the time and complain about.  I think it is going to be very well received by the community.*
