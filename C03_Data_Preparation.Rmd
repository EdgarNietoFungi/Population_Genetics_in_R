Introduction
----
<!--- Nik smells like fairy feets. -->
This section will breifly go over the basics of data import into *poppr*. For this section, we will focus on the GenAlEx format. Other formats are supported and details are given in the R help page for the *adegenet* function `import2genind`. We will show examples of haploid, diploid, and polyploid data sets and show you how you can format your data if it's grouped by multiple 
hierarchical levels. 

GenAlEx data format
----

GenAlEx is a very popular add-on for Microsoft Excel. It is relatively easy to 
use because of its familiar, menu-driven interface. It also gives the user the
option to include information on population groupings, regional groupings, and 
xy coordinates. The flexibility of this format made it a clear choice for import
into *poppr*. 

The data format is standard in that individuals are defined in the rows and loci
are defined in the columns. The first two rows are reserved for metadata and 
the first two columns are reserved for the individual names and population names,
respectively. The examples we will be using are codominant data, but AFLP data
is also accepted. 

To start simple, let's examine the input file for the `monpop` data set containg
694 isolates of *Monolinia fructicola* genotyped over 13 haploid loci 
`r citep(bib["everhart2014finescale"])`. This is a data set that lives within
the *poppr* package and can be loaded with the following command:

```{r}
library(poppr)
data(monpop)
monpop
```

To see how a GenAlEx file can be constructed with this data, we will first write
this data to a file on our desktop with the command `genind2genalex`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
genind2genalex(monpop, filename = "~/Desktop/monpop.csv")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat("Extracting the table ... Writing the table to ~/Desktop/monpop.csv ... Done.")
```

Below is what normal, haploid, GenAlEx data looks like. Highlighted in red is how missing data should be coded for codominant markers. Highlighted in blue are the parts of the metadata rows used by *poppr*. These three numbers represent:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
x <- xtable::xtable(data.frame(list(A = " loci ", B = " individuals ", C = " populations ")))
xtable::print.xtable(x, type = "html", include.rownames = FALSE, 
					 html.table.attributes = "border=2 cellpadding=5 align=center")
```

![monpop](images/monpop.png)

The columns of the metadata beyond those three rows define the number of individuals contained within each population. Since this data is redundant with the second column, it is not necessary. Notice, also, that the second column, reserved for the population assignments, has a a pattern of underscores in the populations. This will be important at the end of this section. Below is a modified version of the input format that should make it easier to format.

![monpop_ideal](images/monpop_ideal.png)

Highlighted in blue is the cell that defines the number of columns highlighted in red. If we set this number to `1`, then we do not have to enter in any information in those columns. Try it for yourself. 

### Diploids

Diploid data is only different in the fact that you will have two alleles represented at each locus. This is coded such that each allele is in a separate column so that your genetic data will take up 2\*(number of loci) columns. Below is an example of the `nancycats` data set (from the *adegenet* package), exported like above. Highlighted in blue and red are the first two loci. 

![diploid](images/diploid.png)

### Polyploids

GenAlEx does not handle polyploids, but since poppr can do it, we have set up a scheme to allow import of polyploids via this format. The limitation is that all of your loci have to have the same observed ploidy. Below is the example of *Phytophthora infestans* in the data set `Pinf` where some genotypes had observed tetraploid loci `r citep(bib["goss2014irish"])`. 

![tetraploid](images/tetraploid.png)

Highlighted in blue is the first locus and highlighted in red are two samples at that locus, an observed diploid and observed triploid. Note the extra zeroes needed to make the genotype tetraploid. 


Other accepted formats
----

The other formats that are supported by *poppr* and *adegenet* are FSTAT, STRUCTURE, GENETIX, and GENEPOP. All of these can be imported with the *adegenet* function `import2genind`. If your data is in a custom format that has the basic form where individuals are in rows and each locus is in a separate column, then you can import your data using the base function `read.table` and then use the *adegenet* function `df2genind` to translate it to a genind object. Note that for polyploid data, it is still important to code your missing data as `0`. 

Population Hierarchies
----

Many data formats do not allow the inclusion of more than one population level. When sampling microbes such as filamentous fungi, it is often not possible to know the true population structure *a priori* and so a hierarchical sampling approach is necessary. In order to get around the limitation of having one population level per data set, we suggest concatenating the different hierarchical levels into a single column by a common separator ("\_" by default). Here's an example of the three hierarchical levels of the `monpop` data set before:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
splithierarchy(monpop) <- ~Tree/Year/Symptom
x <- xtable::xtable(head(gethierarchy(monpop)))
xtable::align(x) <- rep("c", ncol(x) + 1)
xtable::print.xtable(x, type = "html", include.rownames = FALSE, 
  				 html.table.attributes = "border=2 cellpadding=5 align=center")
```

And after:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
x <-head(gethierarchy(monpop, ~Tree/Year/Symptom)[3])
names(x) <- "Tree_Year_Symptom"
x <- xtable::xtable(x)
xtable::align(x) <- rep("c", ncol(x) + 1)
xtable::print.xtable(x, type = "html", include.rownames = FALSE, 
  				 html.table.attributes = "border=2 cellpadding=5 align=center")
```

> If you do not want to concatenate your population factors into one row,
save them as a separate csv file and use the functions `read.table` and `sethierarchy`
after you've imported your genetic data to acheive the same result.

The data imported this way can be accessed with the function `splithierarchy` detailed in [our chapter on population hierarchies](C5_Population_Hierarchies.html).
