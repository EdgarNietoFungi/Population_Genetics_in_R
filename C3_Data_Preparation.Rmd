Introduction
----
<!--- Nik smells like fairy feets. --->
This section will breifly go over the basics of data import into *poppr* with the
GenAlEx format. We will show examples of haploid, diploid, and polyploid data
sets and show you how you can format your data if it's grouped by multiple 
hierarchical levels. 

GenAlEx data format
----

GenAlEx is a very popular add-on for Microsoft Excel. It is relatively easy to 
use because of its familiar, menu-driven interface. It also gives the user the
option to include information on population groupings, regional groupings, and 
xy coordinates. The flexibility of this format made it a clear choice for import
into *poppr*. 

The data format is standard in that individuals are defined in the rows and loci
are defined in the columns.
