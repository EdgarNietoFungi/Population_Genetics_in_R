   <TD VALIGN=TOP><small>**Niklaus J. Gr&uuml;nwald** is a plant pathologist with the USDA Agricultural Research Service and a Professor in the Department of Botany and Pant Pathology and the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing at Oregon State University. He received his PhD from UC Davis and conducted postdoctoral research at Cornell University. His research focuses on understanding the evolutionary patterns and processes of emerging pathogens using population genetic and evolutionary approaches.

   <TD VALIGN=TOP><small>**Zhian N. Kamvar** is a graduate student in the Department of Botany and Pant Pathology at Oregon State University. His research is focused on utilizing population genomics approaches to characterize population structure of the nursery pathogen, *Phytophthora syringae*. His work also involves maintainence of the [*poppr* R package](http://github.com/grunwaldlab/poppr). Zhian is also co-host of the award-winning radio program [Inspiration Dissemination](http://poweredbyorange.com/2013/12/17/science-through-a-microphone/). </small></TD>

   <TD VALIGN=TOP><small>**Sydney E. Everhart** is a USDA-AFRI-NIFA Postdoctoral Fellow at Oregon State University.  Her research utilizes population genetics and genomics to better understand disease dynamics and evolution of fungal plant pathogens.  She developed the micrsoatellite markers and data used in the monpop data set and currently works with genomes, GBS data, and SSR data for *Phytophthora ramorum* in Nik's lab.  After the APS meeting, she will be starting as an Assistant Professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying the emergence and evolution of fungicide resistance within fungal plant pathogen populations.  She is currently seeking a graduate student interested in population genetics of fungi. </small></TD>
