This data is for a population of the diploid plant pathogen *Aphanomyces euteiches* using AFLP as a marker system (<a href="">Gr{\"u}nwald & Hoheisel, 2006</a>). A total of 187 pathogen isolates were sampled hierarchically in two regions in Oregon (N = 97) and Washington (N = 90). The alleles observed were treated as dominant markers with presence or absence. Analysis included clone-correction, genotypic diversity, linkage disequilibrium using the index of association, dendrograms based on Nei's genetic distance, and AMOVA.

This is microsatellite data for a population of the haploid plant pathogen *Monilinia fructicola* that causes disease within peach tree canopies (<a href="">Everhart & Scherm, 2014</a>).  Entire populations within trees were sampled across 3 years (2009, 2010, and 2011) in a total of four trees, where one tree was sampled in all three years, for a total of 6 within-tree populations.  Within each year, samples in the spring were taken from affected blossoms (termed "BB" for blossom blight) and in late summer from affected fruits (termed "FR" for fruit rot).  There are a total of 694 isolates with 65 to 173 isolates within each canopy population that were characterized using a set of 13 microsatellite markers.
