R provides a unique environment for performing population genetic analyses. You will particularly enjoy not having to switch data formats and operating systems to execute a series of analyses, as was the case until now. Furthermore, R provides graphing capabilities that are ready for use in publications, with only a little bit of extra effort. But first, let's install R, install an integrated development environment, open R, and load R packages. 


<!---

## FOR THE SPRING 2014 WORKSHOP

You must have:

1. The latest version of [R](http://www.r-project.org) **(3.1.0)**
2. [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). Think of this as kind of a GUI for R.
3. The latest development version of *poppr* (1.1.0.99) (see below)

**You must download the development version of poppr** (1.1.0.99). You may do this
in several ways:

### If you do NOT have a C compiler or do not know what it is:
 1. In your R console, run the command to install the dependencies of *poppr*: `install.packages(c("adegenet", "pegas", "vegan", "ggplot2", "phangorn", "ape", "igraph"))`
 2. Download the binaries for Windows [[here]](http://grunwaldlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/u5/poppr_1.1.0.99_24.6.14.zip) or OSX [[here]](http://grunwaldlab.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/u5/poppr_1.1.0.99_24.6.14.tgz) and install using the `Tools > Install Packages...` menu command. You should see a window like this:

 ![Install Packages Window](screenshots/InstallPackages.png)

 You should make sure to choose the **Package Archive File** option and then indicate where you downloaded the package in the menubar. If you have downloaded it on your desktop, you would type `~/Desktop/poppr_1.1.0.99.tgz` (on OSX).

### If you have a working C compiler on your system

 You may do install *poppr* via the R package *devtools*:

```{r, devtools, eval=FALSE}
 install.packages("devtools")
 devtools::install_github("grunwaldlab/poppr", ref = "devel")
```

Installing R
-----

1. Download and install the [R](http://www.r-project.org) statistical computing and graphing environment. This works cross-platform on Windows, OS X and Linux operating systems.

2. Download and install the [Rstudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) that we recommend as an integrated development environment.


Installing the required packages
----

The following packages are utilized in this primer:

1. [poppr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poppr/index.html)
2. [adegenet](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adegenet/index.html)
4. [ggplot2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html)
5. [mmod](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mmod/index.html)
3. [genetics](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/genetics/index.html)

Use the following script to install these packages:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("poppr", "mmod", "genetics"))
```

We wrote and actively maintain *poppr* `r citep(bib["kamvar2014poppr"])` and it is heavily relied upon in this primer. *Poppr* is an R package. You can think of a package as a library of functions written and curated by someone in the R user community, which you can be loaded into R for use.

Once you've installed *poppr*, you can invoke (i.e., load) it by typing or cutting and pasting:

```{r, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
library(poppr)
```

This will load *poppr* and all dependent packages, such as *adegenet* and *ade4*. You will recognize loading by the prompts written to your screen.

Congratulations. You should now be all set for using R. Loading data and conducting your first analysis will be the topic of the next chapter. But before we go there lets provide a few useful resources.

A quick introduction to R using Rstudio
----

Next, let's review some of the basic features and functions of R. To start R, open the Rstudio application from your programs folder or start menu. This will initialize your R session. To exit R, simply close the Rstudio application. 

> Note that R is a case sensitive language!

Let's get comfortable with R by submitting the following command on the command line (where R prompts you with a `>` in the lower left Rstudio window pane) that will retrieve the current working directory on your machine:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd() # this command will print the current working directory
```

> Note that the symbol '#' is used to add comments to your code and you just type `getwd()` after the ">".

Other useful commands providing information on your system include:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(options)                                 # learn about available options
installed.packages()[,c("Package","Version")] # list packages & versions installed
sessionInfo()								  # displays packages currently loaded
data(<name>, package = "package")             # load a specific data set from a specific package
```

To quit R you can either use the `Rstudio > Quit` Rstudio pull-down menu command or execute `âŒ˜ + Q` (OS X) or `CTRL + Q` (PC). 

Our primer is heavily based on the *poppr* and *adegenet* packages. To get help on any of their functions type a question mark before the empty function call as in:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?mlg # open the R documentiaon of the function mlg()
```


Some useful resources to learn R
-----

*Free resources*:

 - [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) is a very well thought out R package that teaches you interactively.
 - [Code School Try R](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r) is a nice interactive tutorial. 
 - [Quick R](http://www.statmethods.net/interface/help.html)
 - [R reference card](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf)
 - [Introduction to R](http://ateucher.github.io/rcourse_site/index.html)

*Books*:

 - [R in a Nutshell](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596801717) 
 - [R cookbook]() is a nice quick reference and tutorial for general R use.
 - [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis]() is a great reference if you want to customize graphs for publication. 

Packages and getting help
----

One way that R shines above other languages for analysis is the fact that
R packages in CRAN are all documented. Help files are written in HTML and give
the user a brief overview of:

 - The purpose of a function
 - The parameters it takes
 - The output it yields
 - Some examples demonstrating its usage. 

To see all of the help topics in a package, you can simply type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
help(package = "poppr") # Get help for a package.
help(amova)             # Get help for the amova function.
?amova                  # same as above.
??multilocus            # Search for functions that have the keyword multilocus.
```
Some packages include vignettes that can have different formats such as being introductions, tutorials, or reference cards in PDF format. You can look at a list of vignettes in all packages by typing:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes()                     # see vignettes from all packages
browseVignettes(package = 'poppr')    # see vignettes from a specific package.
```

and to look at a specific vignette you can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette('poppr_manual')
```

We are now ready to think about formatting and loading data into R.
