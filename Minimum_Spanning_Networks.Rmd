title: "99: Minimum Spanning Networks"
---

Minimum spanning networks are a great way to be able to visualize the
connections between samples in your data set. In terms of clonal organisms, it
can be a more powerful visualization tool than trees, especially for clonal
organisms. In this chapter, we will show you how to construct and view minimum
spanning networks on the command line and in an interactive viewer.

# From the command line

### Note:

This section will utilize Bruvo's distance `r citep(bib['bruvo2004simple'])`. 
It is important to note that calculating Bruvo's distance is computationally
different than other distances, so it has its own specialized functions for
minimum spanning networks and bootstrapping that do not need a distance matrix:

| General function | Bruvo specific |
| ---- | ---- |
| `poppr.msn` | `bruvo.msn` |
| `aboot` | `bruvo.boot` |


### Minimum spanning network

For this section, we will use the `monpop` data set from `r citep(bib['everhart2014finescale'])`. 
See [Chapter 6](Genotypic_EvenRichDiv.html) for more details. We will be focusing
on sources of multilocus genotypes. The life cycle of the pathogen *Monilinia
fructicola* begins with an ascospore (sexual propagule) released from a
mummified peach fruit that had overwintered on the ground. It infects an
emerging blossom that, in turn, asexually infects fruit, which proceed with
cyclical infections. We might have questions such as:

1. Are the major genotypes of Fruit Rot (FR) samples closely related?
2. To what degree do the Blossom Blight (BB) samples contribute to the FR?

Let's load the data:

```{r, setup}
library("poppr")
library("magrittr")
data(monpop)
splitStrata(monpop) <- ~Tree/Year/Symptom
summary(monpop)
```

We notice that tree number 26 is the only one to have been sampled for all three
years. Let's use it as an example.

```{r, setup_data}
t26 <- monpop %>% setPop(~Tree) %>% popsub("26") %>% setPop(~Year/Symptom)
t26
```

Now that we have our tree, let's calculate a MSN using Bruvo's distance 
`r citep(bib['bruvo2004simple'])`. Remember that this distance is based on a 
stepwise mutation model, so we have to first specify what kind of repeats units 
we have in our data (eg. dinucleotide = 2, trinucleotide = 3, etc.):

```{r, calculate_msn}
# Set up our repeat lengths and populations to analyze
reps <- c(CHMFc4 = 7, CHMFc5 = 2, CHMFc12 = 4, 
          SEA = 4, SED = 4, SEE = 2, SEG = 6,
          SEI = 3, SEL = 4, SEN = 2, 
          SEP = 4, SEQ = 2, SER = 4)

sub9 <- c("9_BB", "9_FR")

# Calculate the MSN
t26.9msn <- bruvo.msn(t26, replen = reps, sublist = sub9, showplot = FALSE)
```

The minimum spanning network is calculated via `bruvo.msn`. I've set the
argument `showplot = FALSE` because I want to use the more powerful function
`plot_poppr_msn` to view the MSN. In this, I'm telling it to lable none of the
samples, color populations using the "cm.colors" palette and scale the size of
the nodes to $log_{1.25}$. If you want to know what other things this function
can do, simply type `help("plot_poppr_msn")`

```{r, visualize_msn, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
# Visualize the network
set.seed(120)
plot_poppr_msn(t26, t26.9msn, inds = "none", palette = cm.colors, nodebase = 1.25)
```

We can see that the Blossom Blight in the tree (pink pie pieces) heavily
contributed to the major groups of MLGs found in the Fruit Rot (blue pie
pieces).

# Interactive viewer


That seems like a lot of work to create a minimum spanning network, right? If
you look at the all of the arguments for `plot\_poppr\_msn`, there are a whole
lot of them:

```{r, plot_poppr_msn_args}
args(plot_poppr_msn)
```

This is overwhelming even for people who are comfortable with R. Since this
function is designed to provide a visualization after calculation, it only makes
sense to have an interactive, visual interface. This interface is called
`imsn()`. Let's try to recreate the plot above using the `imsn()` function. Note
that the function takes no arguments.

```{r, imsn, eval = FALSE}
imsn()
```

(Note: you probably will not see the whole screen like this, but you can still
scroll down)

![Intial view of imsn](images/imsn_initial.png)

We can see that there are five tabs and a sidebar. For now, we'll explain what
is on the sidebar. The first thing you see is a green bar that says "ready".
This means that there are no processes going on in the background and that it's
ready for input. Below that are three buttons, **Go!**, **reData**, and
**reGraph**. These buttons are how you will tell the program that you are ready
for it to make your graph.

## Parameters (sidebar)

Notice that there are two main sections, **Data Parameters** and **Graphical
Parameters**.

### Data Parameters

As you can expect, these options represent parameters that will manipulate your
data. Changing any of these choices means that the distance matrix will be
recalculated. When you modify things in this section and are satisfied with your
choices, you can use the **reData** button to update the graph. You see here
four choices presented:

1. choose dataset - This dropdown menu allows you to choose your data set.    
   ![choose dataset](images/imsn_data_choose.png)
2. choose populations - this will change based on your data set, but it allows
   you to select different populations with which to subset your data     
   ![choose populations](images/imsn_population_choose.png)
3. convert to genclone? - If your data is in genind format, you can convert it
   to genclone (minimally reduces time for clonal organisms)     
   ![convert to genclone?](images/imsn_convert.png)
3. choose distance calculation - The distance measure to calculate from your
   data (notice that there's "Custom" at the bottom)     
   ![choose distance calculation](images/imsn_distance_choose.png)
4. Distance arguments - every distance has different arguments, this is where
   you can modify them     
   ![Distance arguments](images/imsn_distance_args.png)
6. include reticulations? - This is an important parameter that will include
   reticulations in the minimum spanning network. We'll explore this with the
   `Pram` data set later.     
   ![include reticulations?](images/imsn_reticulate.png)

### Graphical Parameters

The parameters listed here allow you to modify the look and feel of the graph
without having to recalculate the data. We encourage the user to play around
with these to see what the different sliders and buttons do. 

## Output (tabs)

### Plot

This is the tab you see immediately. It has nothing in it because we haven't 
told imsn to do anything. Let's hit **Go!** with our default parameters and 
see what happens.

![minimum spanning network of partial_clone](images/imsn_go.png)

We now have a minimum spanning network of partial clone based a dissimilarity
distance ("diss.dist") where the distance is represented as counts of dissimilar alleles. 

### Data

![partial_clone output](images/imsn_data.png)

This is the output of your data set. You can use this to confirm that your data
is what you expect.

### Command

![partial_clone command](images/imsn_command.png)

If you copy and paste this command into your R console, you can recreate the
minimum spanning network. This is important to make sure that your figure is
reproducible.

```{r, partial_clone_reproduce, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
data("partial_clone") # Don't forget to load the data
partial_clone_sub <- popsub(partial_clone, blacklist = character(0))
partial_clone_dist <- diss.dist(partial_clone_sub, percent = FALSE, mat = FALSE)
min_span_net <- poppr.msn(partial_clone_sub, partial_clone_dist, showplot = FALSE, include.ties = TRUE)

set.seed(69)
plot_poppr_msn(partial_clone,
	       min_span_net,
	       inds = "ALL",
	       mlg = FALSE,
	       gadj = 3,
	       nodebase = 1.15,
	       palette = rainbow,
	       cutoff = NULL,
	       quantiles = FALSE,
	       beforecut = TRUE)
```
