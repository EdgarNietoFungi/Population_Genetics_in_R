title: "Population genetics in R primer"
---

By [*Niklaus J. Gr&uuml;nwald, Zhian N. Kamvar, and Sydney E. Everhart*](Authors.html)

Welcome! This primer provides a concise introduction to conducting applied analyses of population genetic data in R, with a special emphasis on non-model populations including clonal or partially clonal organisms. It provides a valuable resource for tackling the nitty-gritty analysis of populations that do not necessarily conform to textbook genetics and might or might not be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and panmixia. While this primer does not require extensive knowledge of programming in R, the user is expected to install R and all packages required for this primer. *It is important to note that this is still a work in progress and some content might change in the near future.*

>*I was really impressed with what you've accomplished with [poppr], it is very thoughtful and addressed a number of things I never considered but which many pop gen folks that I know deal with all the time and complain about.  I think it is going to be very well received by the community.*
